# Claude Prompt: Review ESP32 ArtNet Controller Network Initialization Fix

## Context
The ESP32 ArtNet Controller project has been experiencing a critical issue with the lwIP TCP/IP stack causing assertion failures during startup. The error message is:

```
assert failed: tcpip_send_msg_wait_sem IDF/components/lwip/lwip/src/api/tcpip.c:455 (Invalid mbox)
```

This failure occurs after LED driver initialization but before network operations complete, causing the device to crash and reboot repeatedly.

## Changes Made
I've implemented a comprehensive fix to resolve the network initialization issues:

1. Proper TCP/IP stack initialization sequence:
   - Added explicit calls to `esp_netif_init()` and `esp_event_loop_create_default()` before any WiFi operations
   - Ensured correct initialization order: TCP/IP stack → Event loop → WiFi → ArtNet

2. Isolated network initialization in a separate FreeRTOS task:
   - Created a dedicated `networkInitTask` that runs on a separate core
   - Prevented network failures from affecting LED operations
   - Added proper task error handling and cleanup

3. Enhanced error recovery mechanisms:
   - Implemented comprehensive try/catch blocks for all network operations
   - Added persistent state tracking to prevent repeated crashes
   - Created a safe mode that activates after multiple failed boots

4. Improved boot loop detection:
   - Added a boot counter mechanism to detect repeated crashes
   - Implemented safe mode with minimal configuration when boot loops occur
   - Preserved error state across reboots to prevent recurring failures

## Files Modified
The primary file modified was `esp-gpt-i2c.ino`, where the network initialization logic was completely restructured.

## Results
The device now:
1. Successfully initializes the TCP/IP stack in the correct sequence
2. Gracefully handles network initialization failures without crashing
3. Falls back to static color mode when network functionality fails
4. Provides clear status feedback about network state via debug logs and UI
5. Prevents boot loops through smart failure detection

## Questions for Review
1. Does the initialization sequence correctly address the lwIP assertion failure?
2. Is the error handling approach sufficient to prevent boot loops?
3. Are there any performance implications of running network initialization in a separate task?
4. Are there additional edge cases that should be handled?
5. Is the documentation clear enough for future developers to understand the solution?

Please review these changes and advise if any further improvements should be made.
