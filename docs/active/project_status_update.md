# ESP32 ArtNet Controller - Project Status Update
*April 19, 2025*

## Current Project Status

The ESP32 ArtNet Controller project has made significant progress in addressing several key issues and implementing new features. This document summarizes the current state of the project and outlines the next steps.

## Recent Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Mode Switching Behavior
- Implemented dynamic mode switching between ArtNet, Static Color, and Color Cycle modes
- Eliminated the need to restart the device when changing modes
- Added proper cleanup and initialization functions for each mode
- Added `applyModeSettings()` function to handle mode transitions
- Committed changes to the main branch (commit ID: 90ef064)

### 2. Circuit Playground Express Integration
- Set up a CircuitPython-based I2C monitor on Circuit Playground Express
- Implemented I2C scanning and communication for monitoring ESP32
- Added visual feedback using NeoPixels to show device status
- Set up button controls and accelerometer-based diagnostics
- Successfully deployed code.py to the device

### 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Setup
- Established MCP knowledge base with three modules (UART, network, LED control)
- Created configuration for syncing between local and desktop MCP systems
- Set up synchronization between systems at 192.168.50.112 and 192.168.50.144
- Successfully tested knowledge base updates and transfer

## Current Architecture

The project is currently structured with the following key components:

### Core ESP32 Implementation
- **Full Version**: Complete implementation with ArtNet, web UI, and effects support
- **Minimal Version**: Lightweight implementation with core functionality

### Supporting Components
- **CircuitPlayground Express Monitor**: External I2C monitor for diagnostics and status
- **UART Communication Bridge**: Interface for external control devices
- **MCP Knowledge Base**: Centralized repository of project knowledge

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: UART Communication Bridge Testing
- Test UART communication between ESP32 and external devices
- Verify command processing and response handling
- Document communication protocol for future reference

### Priority 2: PyPortal Integration
- Develop touchscreen interface for ESP32 control
- Implement status display and configuration options
- Create intuitive UI for mode selection and color picking

### Priority 3: Additional Features
- Implement advanced effects and patterns
- Add music reactivity through audio input
- Develop synchronized multi-device support

## Known Issues

1. Network stack initialization occasionally fails on some ESP32 devices
2. Color cycle modes need performance optimization for smoother transitions
3. Web UI could benefit from mobile responsiveness improvements

## Technical Debt

1. Refactor LED driver code for better memory efficiency
2. Improve error handling and reporting
3. Add comprehensive unit tests for core components
4. Better documentation for user installation and setup

## Documentation Status

The project documentation is continuously being improved:
- MCP knowledge base is up-to-date with latest implementation details
- Troubleshooting guides have been created for common issues
- Setup instructions need updating for new features
