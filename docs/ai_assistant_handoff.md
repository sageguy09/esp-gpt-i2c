# ESP32 ArtNet Controller Project Handoff

## 📋 Current Project Status

The ESP32 ArtNet LED Controller project is making good progress with these key developments:

- **LED Functionality**: LEDs are now correctly turning on and displaying colors
- **Network Stability**: Implemented crash recovery to address lwIP assertion failures
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- **Operational Modes**: System now gracefully handles component failures

**Current critical issue**: The ESP32 experiences lwIP TCP/IP stack assertion failures during network initialization:
```
assert failed: tcpip_send_msg_wait_sem IDF/components/lwip/lwip/src/api/tcpip.c:455 (Invalid mbox)
```

This has been addressed with a comprehensive solution that allows the system to continue operating even when network components fail.

## 🧠 Key Technical Insights

### LED Control
1. **I2SClocklessLedDriver Requirements**:
   - Requires specific pin configuration arrays
   - Needs `WAIT` parameter for reliable updates
   - Buffer clearing is essential before updates
   - Proper initialization sequence is critical

2. **Working Solution**:
   ```cpp
   // Create pin arrays matching exact number of strips
   int pins[activeCount];
   // Fill only with active pins
   
   // Initialize with active pin count
   driver.initled(NULL, pins, activeCount, settings.ledsPerStrip);
   
   // Clear buffer before setting colors
   memset(ledData, 0, sizeof(ledData));
   
   // Apply color
   for (int i = 0; i < totalLEDs; i++) {
     ledData[i].r = red;
     ledData[i].g = green;
     ledData[i].b = blue;
   }
   
   // Update with WAIT for reliability
   driver.showPixels(WAIT);
   ```

### Network Stability
1. **Root Causes of lwIP Assertion**:
   - Resource conflict between LED DMA and WiFi
   - Initialization timing issues
   - Memory corruption
   - Race conditions

2. **Implemented Solution**:
   - Separated LED and network initialization
   - Added persistent failure tracking to prevent crash loops
   - Implemented try/catch blocks around all network code
   - Created graceful degradation with fallback modes

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Layered Approach**:
   - Component isolation (LED operations continue even if network fails)
   - Exception handling throughout codebase
   - Watchdog timer integration with strategic yield() calls
   - Persistent tracking of failure states across reboots

## 📈 Current Status & Next Steps

### Working Features
- LED initialization and control in all modes
- Static color mode functioning
- Color cycle animations working
- OLED status display
- UART communication bridge
- Web interface basic functionality

### Remaining Issues
1. **Network Stability**: While we've implemented robust error handling, some network operations may still cause issues
2. **UI Color Control**: Color picker updates may require multiple attempts
3. **Resource Optimization**: Need to reduce resource competition between subsystems
4. **Boot Loop Issue**: Persistent boot loop under certain conditions related to LED initialization timing, network/LED driver interactions, and error handling gaps

### Next Development Tasks
1. **Verify Network Recovery**: Fully test the network crash recovery implementation
2. **Enhance UI Experience**: Improve the web interface to handle network transitions gracefully
3. **Implement PyPortal Integration**: Begin work on external control via PyPortal
4. **Add OTA Updates**: Implement over-the-air update capability for field recovery

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

When continuing development on this project:

1. **Maintain Component Isolation**:
   - Keep LED functionality independent from network operations
   - Wrap critical sections in try/catch blocks
   - Preserve the ability to operate without network

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test LED functionality independently of network
   - Verify network recovery after disconnections
   - Test all operational modes (ArtNet, Static, Cycle)
   - Validate persistent settings across reboots

3. **Error Recovery Pattern**:
   ```cpp
   try {
     // Attempt operation
   } catch (...) {
     // Log error
     debugLog("Error in component X");
     
     // Fall back to safer mode
     disableComponentX();
     enableFallbackMode();
     
     // Persist state to prevent retry on reboot
     saveSettings();
   }
   ```
