## Known Issues

### LED Output
- Current configuration (single strip on pin 12) not producing visible output despite verified working LEDs
- LED driver initialization parameters may need adjustment for different ESP32 board variants
- Potential timing or data format issues with the I2SClockless library implementation
- Need to debug signal output levels and timing with logic analyzer

### UART Bridge
- Initialization timeout when no device is connected
- Modified to make UART bridge operation optional to avoid blocking main functionality
